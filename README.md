## Overview

The AI-Powered Detection Platform is a transformative solution for security teams that provides a collaborative environment for discovering, sharing, and generating detection content. Following a Product-Led Growth model similar to GitHub, the platform combines a free global detection library managed by AI with premium enterprise features.

### Key Features

- AI-driven detection content generation and optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility with major security platforms
- Collaborative community-driven detection sharing
- Enterprise-grade security and access controls
- Real-time validation and performance optimization
